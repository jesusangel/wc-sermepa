Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WC-Sermepa, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “WC-Sermepa” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our payment gateway plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our payment plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application.

1. Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
2. Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation’s wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.

Automatic updates should work a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

If on the off chance you do encounter issues with the shop/category pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting 'save'. That should return things to normal.
